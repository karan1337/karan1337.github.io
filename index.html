<h2>Industry Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Intern II Technical - Paranoids at Yahoo! (May 2015 - Aug 2015) </b><br/>Responsible for the following with Yahoo's security team - paranoids:- </br>
</br>
1) Aggregate all enterprise logs in a centralized location </br>
2) Develop intrusion detection mechanisms by automating analysis on the collected logs which have millions of events</br>
</br>
Skills Gained and/or Developed:</br>
Big data technologies like Hadoop, Hive and Oozie, Bash Scripting, Python, Java, Splunk API</li></br>
<li><b>Software Engineer at Honeywell (July 2013 - July 2014) </b><br/>As part of digital video manager team which develops IP based security products (video management surveillance systems), my primary job function was to develop C++ components that aid in integration of new cameras from different vendors and Honeywell digital video manager system.</li>
</br><li><b>Intern at Honeywell (Jan 2013 - July 2013)</b><br/> Implemented information security modules (DPAPI, RSA, AES) in C# to facilitate secure communication between software and hardware (EBI Server and EBI client) components involved in a high profile security project for Honeywell access control systems</li>
</br><li><b>Trainee at BSNL (May 2011 - June 2011)</b><br/>Grasped the implementation of Telecom networks, principles of data transmission, signaling, digital switching, fiber optic (SDH and DWDM), broadband and NIB layouts, Intelligent Networks along with GSM and CDMA technologies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2> 
<ul> 
	<li> <b>Forensic Case Investigation</b><br/>
	      Forensically analyzed a suspect's hard drive for evidence relating to an attack plan. Recovered graphic image files by file carving, user accounts, thumbnail databases, analyzed MSN and IRC chat logs, internet history and cookie information and decrypted encrypted evidence. Correlated gathered evidence to create a timeline of events. Created a professional forensic report outlining all findings and evidence</li>
	
	<br/><li> <b>Information Assurance Exercise</b><br/>
      Implemented information assurance principles on a vulnerable virtual company network which included
hardening servers, defending and responding to live injected attacks to ensure uptime of critical services on the network</li>
     
	 <br/><li> <b>Reverse engineering network access control policies on software defined networks</b><br/>
	       It is a research based project aimed at inferring firewall policies on a given SDN network. We experimented with random probing algorithm and smart probing algorithm which made use of machine learning (SVM classifier) to determine network access control policy. We also determined the effectiveness of the above algorithms in python and created a project report detailing theory, implementation and results of our research.</li>
	 
     <br/><li> <b>IPv6 Security</b><br/>
      Created a network scenario as a proof of concept to leverage IPv6 in order to compromise a windows server machine using Armitage(Metasploit) running on Kali Linux</li>

<br/><li> <b>Buffer Overflow Exploitation</b><br/>
      Exploited buffer overflow vulnerability in C by writing shell code to change the runtime behavior of various programs (standalone, client-server) with and without ASLR protection</li>

     <br/><li> <b>Stateful Firewall using Click</b><br/>
	  Built a simple stateful firewall using the modular software router Click which can be used for fast prototyping of routing protocols. Network traffic is inspected against a policy file and decisions are made by the firewall.</li>
	  
      <br/><li> <b>Control-Plane DoS Attack on SDN</b><br/>
      Induced DOS attack by sending random SYN packets to a switch connected to a SDN controller in mininet. The switch was not able to find the matching handling rules and thus forwarded the packet to the controller, thereby flooding it with requests which saturated the SDN control plane.</li>
	  
      <br/><li> <b>Dynamic Taint Tracking</b><br/>
       Implemented a dynamic taint checker for a programming language called SIMPLE (subset of C). The taint checker ensured that no value derived from a secret is ever printed. Developed several test cases that demonstrate that the checker worked correctly.</li>

	<br/><li> <b>Snort and BGP</b><br/>
	  Gained first hand experience with running snort on network traffic capture files and detecting alerts. Wrote simple custom snort rules to detect a sample worm.
	  Analyzed BGP update data using route_btoa tool and plotted graphs depicting BGP route announcements and withdrawal messages at the time slammer worm was launched.</li>

     <br/><li> <b>Coverity</b><br/>
	  Wrote custom static analysis checkers using the Coverity API to enforce desired program properties. Checkers detected usage of unsafe functions in C, modification of random variables, off-by-one and buffer overflow errors and negative shift values.</li>

<br/><li> <b>Web Security Lab</b><br/>
      Gained hands on experience on various prominent web application attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF and Timing Attacks. Documented each attack, clearly explaining the vulnerability and how the exploit works.</li>

      <br/><li> <b>Verification of security properties using SPARK</b><br/>
      Used the SPARK verification tools to explore verification of security properties. Added preconditions and postconditions to existing ADA functions to enforce desired properties. </li>

<br/><li> <b>Digital Steganography</b><br/>
      Implemented and optimized the runtime of the algorithm described in the research paper titled &quot;Digital Steganography for ASCII Text Documents&quot; using C</li>

<br/><li> <b>Fireconfig</b><br/>
      A front end for the linux firewall with basic and advanced filtering features such as creating and modifying custom chains. Monitoring support to view firewall rules as well as active connections simultaneously is included. Incorportes features such as port scanning, information on IP, whois and reverse lookup.</li>

<br/><li> <b>Mobremote</b><br/>
      A secure, cost effective and flexible remote control system that operated via sms service for performing day to day trivial tasks on one's PC.</li>
